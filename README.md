## 📖 About the Project

The purpose of this project is to showcase and practice different features of HTML and CSS.  
It was developed as part of a self-learning process, going through tutorials, exercises, and official references.

The project is divided into two main sections:

- **HTML** → Basic examples using pure HTML only (e.g., headings, paragraphs, lists, links, forms).  
- **CSS** → Extended examples that introduce styling with CSS (layouts, colors, fonts, etc.).

At the end of each section, you will find complete exercises combining concepts, such as forms created entirely with HTML or styled with CSS.
